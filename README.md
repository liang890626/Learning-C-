#Practice1--calculate area of the rectangle

Create a program that takes in user input for the length and width of a rectangle, and then calculates and displays the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
Here are the steps to implement this program:

1.Declare two variables to store the length and width of the rectangle. You can use the double data type to allow for decimal values.

2.Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle using cout. You can use cin to get user input.

3.Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle using the formulas:
  
  。area = length * width
  
  。perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

4.Display the results using cout.

5.End the program.
